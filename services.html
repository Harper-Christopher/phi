            <p>Concerned about Mold?</p>
            <p>Molds have the potential to cause health problems, and can cause asthma attacks in people who are allergic to mold. It can irritate the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs.</p>
            <p>Tests identify:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Type of mold (common or toxic)</li>
                <li>Mold spore count (what you are breathing)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="margin-bottom">Radon Inspection</h2>
            <h5 class="margin-top">(Duration varies • Ask For Price)</h5>
            <p>Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer, after smoking. The more elevated a home's radon level, the greater the health risk to you and your family. Smokers and former smokers are especially at high risk.</p>
            <h4>Deaths Per Year Comparison:</h4>
            <p>Radon Deaths: 21,000<br>
            Drunk Driving Deaths: 17,400<br>
            Falls in the home: 8,000<br>
            Carbon Monoxide: 430</p>
            
            <p>The EPA recommends testing every 2 years to confirm your radon levels are not rising.</p>
            
            <p>Is is time to test your home?</p>

            <h2 class="margin-bottom large-center">Meth Testing</h2>
            <h5 class="margin-top large-center">(30 minutes • Ask For Price)</h5>
            <p>During our meth testing training we were told that one of every 10 homes in Utah have meth in it. Certain levels of meth in a home can cause serious effects on someone. When Meth is ingested, it has an immediate effect on the central nervous system.
                You can't see or smell meth. Samples have to be taken and the test results will tell us if it is present and how much. 
                Don't take a change with your family, test to make sure it's not in your home, especially prior to purchasing a new home.</p>
