            <p>Buying a home is one of life's most stressful and expensive decisions. For this reason, we focus on being THOROUGH AND HONEST. This is so important to us that we made it our business motto.</p>
            <p>Aside from being thorough and honest, the following are factors that set us apart and I hope will help you decide that we are a good fit for you.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>I am a member of the Salt Lake Board of Realtors and have Supra access so you never have to meet me there to let me in.</li>
                <li>Home Inspections and testing are VERY affordable.</li>
                <li>If I can't walk on the roof for the roof inspection, I will use a drone if weather permits.</li>
                <li>I work days and evenings Monday - Saturday. I work around you and the realtors schedule.</li>
                <li>I can assist with additional testing as desired. Mold, Meth, Radon, Lead Paint, Asbestos, and Sewer Pipe inspection.</li>
                <li>I can also help when you are selling a home by doing repairs and other jobs to ensure the home is ready to sell. I have many years of handyman experience.</li>
                <li>I have over 20 years in or managing customer service teams which has taught me critical soft skills as well as why it's SO important to truly care about you and your needs.</li>
                <li>I maintain a high customer review rating.</li>
